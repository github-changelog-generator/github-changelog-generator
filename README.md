### Changelog generation has never been so easy:

**Fully automate changelog generation** - This gem generate change log file based on **tags**, **issues** and merged **pull requests** (and split them to separate lists according labels) from :octocat: GitHub Issue Tracker.

Since now you don't have to fill your `CHANGELOG.md` manually: just run script, relax and take a cup of :coffee: before your next release!

### *What’s the point of a change log?*
To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.

## Installation

	[sudo] gem install github_changelog_generator

## Output example

- Look at **[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)** for this project
- [ActionSheetPicker-3.0/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  was generated by command:

		github_changelog_generator -u skywinder -p ActionSheetPicker-3.0

- In general it looks like this:

> ## [1.2.5](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/tree/1.2.5) (2015-01-15)
> 
> [Full Changelog](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/compare/1.2.4...1.2.5)
> 
> **Implemented enhancements:**
> 
> - Use milestone to specify in which version bug was fixed [\#22](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/issues/22)
> 
> **Fixed bugs:**
> 
> - Error when trying to generate log for repo without tags [\#32](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/issues/32)
> 
> **Merged pull requests:**
> 
> - PrettyPrint class is included using lowercase 'pp' [\#43](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/pull/43) ([schwing](https://github.com/schwing))
> 
> - support enterprise github via command line options [\#42](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/pull/42) ([glenlovett](https://github.com/glenlovett))


## Usage
**It's really simple**: 

- If your **git remote** `origin` refer to your GitHub repo, then just go to your project folder and run:

		github_changelog_generator

-  or from anywhere:
    - `github_changelog_generator -u github_username -p github_project`
    - `github_changelog_generator  github_username/github_project`
     
As output you will get `CHANGELOG.md` file with pretty *Markdown-formatted* changelog.

### GitHub token

Since GitHub allow to make only 50 requests without authentication it's recommended to run this script with token (`-t, --token` option)

**You can easily [generate it here](https://github.com/settings/applications)**.

And:

- Run with key `-t [your-16-digit-token]` 
- Or set environment variable `CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN` and specify there your token. 
 		
	i.e. add to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` or any other place to load ENV variables string :

        export CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN="your-40-digit-github-token"

So, if you got error like this:
>! /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/github_api-0.12.2/lib/github_api/response/raise_error.rb:14:in `on_complete'

It's time to create this token or wait for 1 hour before GitHub reset the counter for your IP.

    - Ability to manually specify in which version issue was fixed (in case, when closed date is not match) by setting `milestone` of issue the same name as tag of  required version
    - Ability to **exclude specific issues** from change log (by labels) :negative_squared_cross_mark:
    - **Automatically exclude "questions"** - issues marked as `question` labels (and other issues, that shouldn't be in change log file: with `duplicate invalid wontfix` labels)  :scissors:
