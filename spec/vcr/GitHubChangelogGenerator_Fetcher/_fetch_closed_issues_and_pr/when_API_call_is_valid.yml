        automatically generated change log file.\r\n\r\nHi, as I can see, you are
        carefully fill tags and labels for issues in your repo.\r\n\r\nFor such cases
        I create a [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator),
        that generate change log file based on **tags**, **issues** and merged **pull
        requests** from :octocat: Issue Tracker.\r\n\r\nThis PR add change log file
        to your repo (generated by this script).\r\nYou can look, how it''s look like
        here: [Change Log](https://github.com/skywinder/#{@options[:project]}/blob/add-change-log-file/#{@options[:output]})\r\n\r\nSome
        essential features, that has this script:\r\n\r\n-  it **exclude** not-related
        to changelog issues (any issue, that has label `question` `duplicate` `invalid`
        `wontfix` )\r\n- Distinguish issues **according labels**:\r\n    - Merged
        pull requests (all `merged` pull-requests)\r\n    - Bug fixes (by label `bug`
        in issue)\r\n    - Enhancements (by label `enhancement` in issue)\r\n    -   Issues
        (closed issues `w/o any labels`)\r\n- Generate neat Change Log file according
        basic [change log guidelines](http://keepachangelog.com).\r\n\r\nYou can easily
        update this file in future by simply run script: `github_changelog_generator
        #{@options[:repo]}` in your repo folder and it make your Change Log file up-to-date
        again!\r\n\r\nHope you find this commit as useful. :wink:"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/skywinder/changelog_test/issues/4","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/skywinder/changelog_test","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/skywinder/changelog_test/issues/4/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/skywinder/changelog_test/issues/4/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/skywinder/changelog_test/issues/4/events","html_url":"https://github.com/skywinder/changelog_test/pull/4","id":59844195,"number":4,"title":"fix
